        </header>
        <p>
          Frogger is a video game I think of every time I cross my street on a
          busy day to get to my mailbox and an undeniable arcade classic.
          Frogger was released worldwide in 1981. In Japan and Europe, the game
          was released by Konami/Sega, and in North America, Frogger was
          released under Sega/Gremlin industries.

              Hmm…I wonder if it's those Gremlins. Is it those Gremlins? If so,
              it is probably another reason not to feed them after midnight.
              They had their own industries and were trying to go for world
              domination. Or maybe it's another reason to support the Gremlins.
              Hey, it takes work and vision to start your own industry.

              So in the game, you play as Frogger. You are a little frog that
              has to make it to the other side of the screen. You can move
              front, back, left, or right to dodge traffic, swim on the tops of
              logs and turtles, dodge alligators, and reach the other side. On
              the other side of the screen, you have to put Frogger in an open
              space that you have not yet occupied. There are five open spaces,
              and Frogger must get over to the other side five times to progress
              through the levels. Sometimes an alligator is in one of the open
              spaces, so be careful. Ultimately it is up to you to prevent
              Frogger from becoming roadkill, drowning, or becoming an
              Alligator’s dinner.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are some ways of scoring bonus points. If you see a bright
              pink female frog, you can lift her to the other side. Also,
              sometimes in the open space is a fly. Get the fly.

              Frogger was an arcade hit. Because Frogger was so popular, they
              were ported to many home consoles. If you have a vintage game
              store or like shopping on eBay, you can likely find a version for
              your vintage hardware.

              If you like Frogger and want to play a similar game look for
              Freeway. Freeway was released by Activision in 1981. In it you
              play as a chicken. Your chicken has to cross the road. You can
              only move your chicken up or down. It is a little more difficult.
              Besides the Atari cartridge look for it on Activision Classics for
              PS1

          There has also been some fun Frogger upgrades and sequels over the
          years. While I haven’t played all of them, I recommend Frogger 2
          Swampy’s Revenge from 2000. It came out on (PlayStation, Windows,
          Dreamcast, Game Boy Color).
